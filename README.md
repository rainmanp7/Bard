bard congestion control.

## Information / Social
### Twitter @BardCongestion


## Usage.
The c code can be used as a Linux module stand alone.
The other code is for reference and useable.

## Contributing.
Myself and a few Artificial intelligence helped me code check
Google Bard helped me create and write this code
There were many hours and days myself and Google Bard
worked hard to make this possible.

## Background Understanding.
This is a congestion control program for the Linux kernal
This is Google Bards first complete C programming congestion
contorl program written and functional. Any programmer can use this
code to write there own program or module. I want to see this on
the Android App possibly using a vpn switch ,but it should be ingrained
in the operating system it's self. It's currently ready for testing
as a Linux kernal module. it's gone through heavy simulator
testing and is ready now for real world testing.

## Current Status.
This is in it's Alpha/Beta Stages now.
