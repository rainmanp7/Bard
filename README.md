Myself and a few Artificial intelligence helped me code check
Google Bard helped me create and write this code

## Background Understanding.
```
This is a congestion control program Linux kernal module.
This is Google Bards first complete C programming congestion
contorl program written and functional. Any programmer can use this
code to write there own program or module. I want to see this on
the Android App possibly using a vpn switch ,but it should be ingrained
in the operating system it's self. It's currently ready for testing
as a Linux kernal module. it's gone through heavy simulator
testing and is ready now for real world testing.
